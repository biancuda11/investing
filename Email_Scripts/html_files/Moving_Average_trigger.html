    <p>Aloha {name},</p>
    <p>The table below is a list of stocks from the S&P500 and NASDAQ in which the 50D Moving Average
      and the 100D Moving Average crossed following the close of the past trading day.</p>
    <p>Note: I highly recommend watching the <a href="https://youtu.be/Ax3YWbxBKtk">Introduction video on YouTube</a> as well as the <a href="https://youtu.be/gfEjP0KA5Qc">TradingView Setup </a> video prior to interpreting the table below.</p>
    <p>
      {table}
    </p>

    <p><strong>New </strong>: The table below is a list of stocks where the price closed above the 100 day moving average</p>
    <p>
      {table_100day}
    </p>

    <p>Disclaimer: None of this should be taken as trading advice. It's simply an alert email to notify the receiver of when a condition is present in the market (50 day moving avg crosses the 100day moving avg.)</p>

    <p>Happy trading and have a great day, <br>
      Dan
